## Assignment Suggestions
If this assignment were to be modified in order to become an "official" assignment in the future, it would be neat to have it alongside a lecture on the importance of relational databases and the risks of dirty writes. Additionally, including example test cases would clarify expectations and help students handle edge cases. I think the assignment could also be a parter activity in part two, tying it to the React lecture and having partners implement each other's UI. I think reading and interpreting someone else's code and trying to make a frontend out of it would be beneficial.
